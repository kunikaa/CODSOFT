Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction  
Built a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python  
Created a regression model to predict IMDb ratings of Indian movies using attributes like genre, director, duration, and actors.

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification  
Developed a classification model using machine learning algorithms to identify the species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on petal and sepal measurements.

Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python  
Used linear regression to predict product sales using advertising data such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets.

Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection  
Trained a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest. Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
